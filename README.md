These are my steps on the Data Structure grade, so there will be classes, projects, issues that i had. The main programming language used in this grade is Java using the concepts of POO.

# Data Structure

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient acess and modification.

## Static Allocation

### <div id="static-queue" />Queue

A queue in computational terms is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. This operation is called FIFO (First in first out).

### <div id="static-stack" />Stack

A stack uses the same concept of the queues but instead of using the FIFO operation uses LIFO, that means that the first entity inserted will be the last taken out.

### <div id="static-list" />List

A list is when an entity inserted will be inserted on the desired location and will be no order to take out, any entity on the list can be popped out.

## Dynamic Allocation

In dynamic allocation of memory, when you need for example to increase your vector size it will be allocated more memory for usage. Gives more flexibility but always when inserting a new entity the memory will be allocated.
